# Time Series Analysis and development of time series model that forecast energy consumption for the next 1000 hours or more

### Project Description:

In this project, I explored the energy consumption dataset for XYZ company and leveraged various techniques to cleanse, preprocessed and engineered features that allowed me cover great insights that are contributive features to determining the rate of energy consumption considering the type of activities carried out. The dataset comprises of the OPERATIONAL and INDUSTRIAL energy consumption for the XYZ company.

To bring this to perspective, I leveraged on the Time Series Techniques to cover deeper insights on the dataset considering their historical patterns over time and how each consumption varies wih respect to underlining activities.

The focus of this project is to develop a robust algorithm that capable of estimating the energy consumption for the nearest future in hours leveraging on all underlying attributes in the historical events in the dataset and productionalize this model using streamlit and gradio for public consumption. The project will also performed indepth exploratory data analsis to cover broader scope and contexts in the time series data to drives decision-making.

### Modules and Packages:
`pip install python 3.12.1`

`pip install gradio`

`pip install streamlit`

### Strategies and Techniques:

- Explore each dataset related to activities over time and build model that can estimate for future inference.
  
- Aggregated the OPERATION and INDUSTRIAL energy consumption to obtain the total energy consumption for XYZ company.
  
- Explore the total energy dataset and developed a machine learning model that estimate the total energy in Kilowatts for any given future hours.
  
- Built functions that automatatically engineered features and preprocessing for futuristic prediction.

- Corrected missing values using the mean strategy.

- Two algorithms were trained on the data - `Lasso` and `RandomForestRegressor`.

- Productionalize the total energy model into streamlit and gradio.

### Analyzing the Operational Energy Consumption:

![1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/479c6dca-f71e-4238-955e-397b07f17fd8)
The operational energy consumption for the company XYZ experience its peak between the 8 hours and 16 hours time shift which suggest that company XYZ runs an 8 hour operational shifting operation with highest consumption at the job shift.

![3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c52cebe-9874-446b-a919-9918bb32f1cf)
The operational energy consumption for the company XYZ experience its monthly peak between June to August with its highest monthly consumption in July every year. The company operations experience lowest energy consumption in April every year.

### Analyzing the Industrial Energy Consumption:

![4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af996a05-9094-4908-9008-6e15380516c7)
The industrial energy consumption for the company XYZ experience continuous declination from the 0th hour until the 8 hours shift and above 16 hours shift with nearly linear increase onward daily.

![5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/67392dec-15a1-4a4d-a69a-ad8487a5fb15)
The industrial energy consumption for the company XYZ experience higher increase on mondays and fridays for the industrial energy consumption.

![6](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/209ed38e-f15b-4fb2-a59b-02c30168e91c)
The industrial energy consumption for the company XYZ experience higher increase in March and May every year for industrial energy consumption.

### Analyzing the total energy consumption:

![7](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3346b1db-bca2-4bd3-b817-99f4e49b00db)
The total energy consumption for the company XYZ experience between 8 hours and 16 hours shift.
